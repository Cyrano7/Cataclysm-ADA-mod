This bayonet also functions as a wire cutter, and a mediocre saw for cutting through aircraft fuselage.  That the handle and tang can be completely disassembled from the blade is surely a fact of great comfort to the soldier, survivalist, and you.",

The blade is made of stainless steel and the handle of a lightweight and durable plastic.  It features a middling metal saw on the spine of the blade, and can function as a wire cutter as well.  Though it is quite sturdy, it can't hold an edge very well."
