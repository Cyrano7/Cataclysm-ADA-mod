# Cataclysm Anomalous Days Ahead
A work in progress S.T.A.L.K.E.R. themed content mod for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead. [WARNING: Save compatibility between commits not guaranteed!]

# THEME
### Primary Sources
* S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series
* Roadside picnic book

### Secondary Sources
* Metro game series: For some monsters, items, and lore snippets. Not for world setting, just for flavor bits and content.

### General World
* Russian/Eastern European Location.
* Rolling present day start time.
* Instead of a larger world event this cataclysm is limited to an anomalous 'Zone' that the normal world still exists outside of. 
* Items such as currency, jewelry, gems, and precious metals still have value.

# DESIGN GOALS
* Removal of fictional and scifi items that don't fit into the theme.
* More emphasis on buying, scavenging, and looting instead of crafting.
* More specific items. Having named or branded(when possible) instead of generic items.
